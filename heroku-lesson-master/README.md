# Deploying to Heroku with Rails & Postgres

## Before You Do Anything

1. Make sure your app is under version control with `git`.  If you're not sure if your project is under version control yet, you definitely haven't been committing often enough. Run `git status` to check if your project directory is a git repo. If not, run `git init` to make it into one, then commit everything you have so far. **If you have any secret keys (such as API keys), <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv" target="_blank">hide them in environment variables</a> before committing!**

2. If you haven't already, sign up for a <a href="https://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku account</a>.

3. If you haven't already, install the <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku toolbelt</a>.

## Create Your Heroku App

1. Add a new remote to your project repository that points to Heroku's servers. **Your project must be a git repo to continue.**

  In the Terminal, from your project's root directory, run:

	```zsh
	➜  heroku create YOUR_APP_NAME
	```

  If you don't supply a name for your app, Heroku will create a random one for you. We strongly suggest giving your app a name to personalize it and reflect its purpose.

2. Also in the Terminal, from your project's root directory, run:

  ```zsh
  ➜  git remote -v
  ```

  You should see something like this:

  ```zsh
  heroku	https://git.heroku.com/YOUR_APP_NAME.git (fetch)
  heroku	https://git.heroku.com/YOUR_APP_NAME.git (push)
  origin	https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME.git (fetch)
  origin	https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME.git (push)
  ```

## Prepare Your App for Deploy

1. Check your `Gemfile` to make sure you're using the `pg` gem:

  ```ruby
  #
  # Gemfile
  #

  gem 'pg'
  ```

2. Add the `rails_12factor` gem to your `Gemfile` in the production group:

  ```ruby
  #
  # Gemfile
  #

  group :production do
    gem 'rails_12factor'
  end
  ```
  
3. Also, move the sqlite3 gem into the development/test block in the Gemfile:

   ```ruby
  #
  # Gemfile
  #

  group :development, :test do
  
    gem 'sqlite3'
  end
  ```
  

3. Run this command in your Terminal to bundle install locally:

  ```zsh
  ➜  bundle install --without production
  ```

## Deploy to Heroku

1. You should be all set up now, so add and commit your changes, then push to Heroku:

  ```zsh
  ➜  git status
  ➜  git add -A
  ➜  git commit -m "ready for deploy"
  ➜  git push origin master
  ➜  git push heroku master
  ```

  Your Terminal output should look something like this (but a little longer):

  ```zsh
  Initializing repository, done.
  Counting objects: 64, done.
  Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
  Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
  Writing objects: 100% (64/64), 14.57 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
  Total 64 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0)

   * [new branch]      master -> master
  ```

2. **This is a common point for people to run into errors.** The most common error that happens here is your assets failing to compile. **If you have errors, try this possible solution:**

  * From the Terminal, precompile your assets:

    ```zsh
    ➜  rake assets:precompile
    ```

  * Add and commit new changes, then try pushing to Heroku again:

    ```zsh
    ➜  git status
    ➜  git add -A
    ➜  git commit -m "precompiling assets"
    ➜  git push origin master
    ➜  git push heroku master
    ```

3. Your deployed app has a separate database from your development environment. To set up your Heroku database, run your migrations in production:

  ```zsh
  ➜  heroku run rake db:migrate
  ```

4. If all went well, you should be able to visit your live application by running:

  ```zsh
  ➜  heroku open
  ```

## Debugging

Hopefully your app works on Heroku, however, you may see a sad page that looks like this...

![heroku-application-error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7833470/10436335/9a97efce-70da-11e5-87ba-bdb4ae0c8596.png)

1. If this happens to you, check your Heroku logs in the Terminal:

  ```zsh
  ➜  heroku logs
  ```

2. Scan all of the logs for error messages. If you see obvious error messages, google what they mean. If you still can't find a solution, now would be a good time to ask an instructor for help.

## Add Your API Keys

1. Set environment variables on Heroku:

  *Change MY_API_KEY to your variable name and your actual key*

  ```zsh
  ➜  heroku config:set MY_API_KEY=0932nv8d17vhd72o2e8cfv82csd9n1dcd98
  ```

2. Check that it worked:

  ```zsh
  ➜  heroku config
  MY_API_KEY: 0932nv8d17vhd72o2e8cfv82csd9n1dcd98
  ```

3. If you made a mistake and need to unset an API key:

  ```zsh
  ➜  heroku config:unset MY_API_KEY
  Unsetting MY_API_KEY and restarting myapp... done, v13
  ```
