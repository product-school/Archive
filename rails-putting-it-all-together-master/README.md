# Rails: Putting It All Together


Today we're going to spend time working through the "Getting Started With Rails" docs.  Our reasoning behind this is to see how different error messages work.  It is also to see a consistent work flow when putting your Models, Views, and Controllers together.  Our hope is that this is a straight forward lesson that helps solidify the knowledge learned from your previous two lessons.

### Looking forward:

In our next lesson we will be implementing the 'Devise' gem to add a 'Users' table and provide authentication and authorization for our web application.
